  ## 1. Features
  
  - Depth First Search ⇒ insertion of words into the trie data structure & auto-completion of words based on a given prefix.
  - File I/O ⇒ loading words from a dictionary file to build the trie.
    

  ## 2. Usage
  
  - Building the program ⇒ compile the Java source code to generate the executable class files.
  - Running the program ⇒ execute the compiled program using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  - Searching for Words: ⇒ enter search queries at the command-line prompt to find auto-completion suggestions. Type "exit" to quit the         program.
    

  ## 4. Application Structure
  
  - `ACT.java` ⇒ main Java source code file containing the implementation of the ACT program.
  - `Dictionary2.txt` ⇒ sample dictionary file containing a list of words for testing the program.
